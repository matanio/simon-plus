# Simon+

Simon+ is a game based on the popular sequence game Simon. This website is strictly non-commercial, and is in no-way affiliated with the offical game.

This is simply a step in my software engineering journey!
As someone who has only dealt with Javascript, HTML and CSS in small batches, I wanted to see what I could create using the popular framworks and libraries of Vue.js and Tailwind.css.
I will be updating and maintaining Simon+ as time goes, and hopefully you enjoy oplaying it as much as I enjoyed making it!
